Graphs:
It can be accessed using two ways: 1. DFS, 2. BFS
#DFS: It is about recursively visisting the paths if they are unvisited.
#BFS: It is about using a queue and visiting a node and all its neighbours before moving to other node.
 Problems:
1. Detect a cycle using DFS-> Concept of parent and neighbour node if it the currently visited is visited and it is not parent then it has a loop.

Algorithms:1. Khans Algorithm(BFS) for topological sort->  1.First find indegree of all vertices and then
                                                           2. push zero indegree vertices to queue.
                                                           3. Until the queue is empty take front vertex in queue  add it to answer and decrese all of its neighbour vertices indegree by 1.
                                                           4. In this process any of the vertex indegree is zero add it to queue.
